    <h2>Leena Al-Rababah</h2>

    <p>I am Leena. I am 23 years old and live in Irbid city. I have a bachelor's degree in Translation field 
       from Faculty of Arts, Yarmouk University in 2021. One of my most important goals in my live is to be a professional programmer. 
       Therefore, I am now writing my first code, and Insha'Allah I will build my success story from this code specifically.

    <p>My favourite hobby is reading. I love getting lost in a good book and escaping into different worlds and characters.
          Reading helps me to relax and unwind after a long day, and it also helps me to know about new things and expand
          the horizon of my knowledge.</p>
